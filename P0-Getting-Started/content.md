> This tutorial builds upon your previous experience and will intentionally be in parts, be less verbose and offer more coding challenges along the way.  As always if you need help, please ask :]

#What you will learn

Lots of cool things!!!!

Throughout this tutorial you will learn many concepts including how to:

- Use CocoaPods to elegantly scale your project
- Create a Facebook app
- Implement the Facebook SDK for user authentication
- Implement the Firebase SDK to read/write player profiles
- Use asynchronous methodology to avoid thread locking
- Create *SKSpriteNodes* using remotely stored image assets

#Time to get started

You will be building on top of your existing Sushi Neko project. To ensure you have a clean working foundation  please [Download the project solution](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/Sushi-Neko-SpriteKit-Swift-Solution/) and unzip to your favorite working folder.

Don't open the project just yet, in the next chapter you will be setting up CocoaPods and this requires the project to be closed.

Welcome to bonus stage, your challenge should you accept, is to work through the list of challenges and take your game to the next level.

There are no solutions provided and I would encourage you to discuss potential solutions with your fellow students, it's good to collaborate and often results in new exciting directions.

If you have any challenge suggestions, we would love to hear them.  Please feedback at the [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/Sushi-Neko-Networking-SpriteKit-Swift)

It would be a good idea to create a **new branch** in your repo for these challenges.
